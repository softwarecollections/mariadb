Settings specific for MariaDB specific are defined in appropriate section in
/etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf (part of mariadb-server).
It doesn't matter that we set these settings only for [mysqld] here,
because they will be read and used in mysqld_safe as well.
Settings in my.cnf are generic for all MySQL implementations because of
conflict issues.
